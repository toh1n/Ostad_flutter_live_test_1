Develop a Flutter app with a single screen that includes the following features:
AppBar: Customize the AppBar's background color, elevation, center-aligned title,
and add at least two icons to the actions section.
Drawer: Include a banner with a custom message or image, and add two menu items
using ListTile widgets.
Body: Customize the Scaffold's body with your preferred content, such as text,
images, or any other widget.
Floating Action Button (FAB): Position the FAB in the bottom left corner, increase its
size, and change its color to a custom choice.
Implement the above features to create a visually appealing and functional Flutter
app with a single screen.
